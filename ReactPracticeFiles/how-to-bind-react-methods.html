	// ES6 introduced new class syntax used for creating React component classes. Function context calls within ES6 classes follow same principles as rest of JS.

	// This means that:

	class Foo {
		constructor() {
			this.x = 2;
			this.y = 4;
		}

		bar() {
			// ...
		}

		baz() {
			// ...
		}
	}

	// is roughly the same as:

	function Foo() {
		this.x = 2;
		this.y = 4;

		this.bar = function() { //... };
		this.baz = function() { //... };
	}

	// When React.createClass was used, binding problem was non-existent because all methods defined on an object passed to React.createClass were automatically bound.
	// IN ES6 you must bind your methods manually (event handlers and functions passed down as properties [callbacks])
	// React assumes you have render method within component class. While rendering, component is instantiated from class by using `new` method. Since component extends from React.Component, it inherits setState and forceUpdate functions.
	// May have component lifecycle methods called under hood with .componentDidUpdate() - `this` is properly binded to component instance.
	// Must have render method - also called with method pattern.

	// Event handlers passed as properties like onChange or onClick can come from many sources
	// Therefore, best place to bind them is in constructor.

	class InputExample extends React.Component {
		constructor(props) {
			super(props);

			this.state = { text: '' };

			this.change = this.change.bind(this);
		}

		change(ev) {
			this.setState({ text: ev.target.value });
		}

		render() {
			let { text } = this.state;
			return (
				<input type="text" value={text} onChange={this.change} />
			);
		}
	}

	// Arrow functions always get the context from where they have been defined.

	change = (ev) => this.setState({ text: ev.target.value }); // is equivalent to

	var that = this;
	change = function(ev) { return that.setState({ text: ev.target.value }); };

	// Final refactored result

	class InputExample extends React.Component {
		state = { text: '' };
		change = (ev) => this.setState({text: ev.target.value});

		render() {
			let {text} = this.state;
			return (<input type="text" value={text} onChange={this.change} />);
		}
	}
